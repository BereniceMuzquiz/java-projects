# java-projects
This Repository contains my latest java projects

The clientSocket and the stringsplitter are plugins that extend the open source  AsTeRICS-Framework of the FH-Technikum Wien and are part of the project "Computer control through Facial expressions. Integration of OpenFace in AsTeRICS and creation of models for facial expression recognition".

The clientSocket plugin, receives the tracked data from server-sockets to integrate them in AsTeRICS . 
The stringsplitter plugin, separates and selects the needed data to be processed for other plugins to control the computer mouse. 

Note: I worked in a team with professors from the FH-Technikum for the implementation of the clientSocket and for the extension of the stringsplitter plugin.
