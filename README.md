# java-projects
This Repository contains my latest java-projects

They clientsocket and the stringsplitter are plugins to expan the open source  AsTeRICS-Framework of the FH-Technikum-Wien and are part of the projekt "Computer control through Facial expressions. Integration of OpenFace in AsTeRICS and creation of models for facial expression recognition".

The clientSocket -plugin, receives the tracked data from server-sockets to integrate them in AsTeRICS . 
The stringsplitter -plugin, separates and selects the needed data to be processed for other plugins to control the computer mouse. 

Note: I worked as a team with professors from the FH tecnikum for the implementation of the client socket and for the extension of the stringspliter plugin
